              <p className="text-muted-foreground text-lg leading-relaxed mb-6">
                For generations, talcum powder was marketed as the epitome of purity and safety, a product gentle enough for babies and recommended for women's most intimate hygiene needs. Today, thousands of California women face ovarian cancer diagnoses, and both men and women confront mesothelioma, after decades of using products contaminated with asbestos and linked to cancer development.
              </p>
              <p className="text-muted-foreground text-lg leading-relaxed mb-6">
                The betrayal runs deeper than simple product defects. Internal documents reveal manufacturers tested their talc, found asbestos contamination, and chose to hide these results while specifically marketing powder for feminine hygiene use. This targeted marketing to women for genital use, despite known cancer risks, represents one of the most egregious examples of corporate profits over consumer safety in modern history.
              </p>
              <p className="text-muted-foreground text-lg leading-relaxed">
                California women trusted these products for decades, using them after bathing, on sanitary pads, and for daily freshness, never knowing each application potentially planted seeds of future cancer. At Trembach Law Firm, we leverage former defense attorney experience to expose how manufacturers knew their talc contained cancer-causing asbestos yet continued aggressive marketing while concealing deadly risks.

                    Ovarian cancer cases form the largest category of talc litigation, affecting women who used powder for feminine hygiene over years or decades. Regular application to underwear, sanitary pads, or directly to the genital area created chronic exposure allowing talc particles to travel through the reproductive tract. The inflammatory response to these foreign particles, combined with potential asbestos contamination, triggered cellular changes leading to cancer development.

                    Mesothelioma cases involve cancer of the mesothelium, the protective lining surrounding lungs, heart, or abdomen, caused by asbestos fibers in contaminated talc. Regular talc powder use created airborne asbestos exposure during application, particularly when powder was shaken from containers creating dust clouds. Parents powdering babies, women applying powder after bathing, and barbers using talc on customers all faced inhalation exposure.

                    These related cancers affecting reproductive system tissues share similar causation mechanisms with ovarian cancer from talc exposure. Fallopian tube cancer, though rarer than ovarian cancer, follows similar development patterns from talc particle migration and inflammation. Primary peritoneal cancer affects the abdominal lining, developing through similar inflammatory processes.

              <p className="text-muted-foreground text-lg leading-relaxed mb-6">
                The scientific connection between talc use and cancer has strengthened considerably over the past several decades. Epidemiological studies consistently show increased ovarian cancer risk among women who used talcum powder for feminine hygiene. The proposed mechanism involves talc particles traveling through the reproductive tract, causing inflammation that eventually leads to cancerous changes.

              <p className="text-muted-foreground text-lg leading-relaxed mb-6">
                When talc is contaminated with asbestos, the cancer risk multiplies, as asbestos is a known carcinogen causing mesothelioma and other cancers. Historical product testing reveals manufacturers knew their talc contained asbestos yet continued marketing without warnings. Internal memoranda discuss contamination findings and debates about disclosure.
