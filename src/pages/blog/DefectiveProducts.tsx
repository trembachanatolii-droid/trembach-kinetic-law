            <p className="text-xl text-gray-600 leading-relaxed mb-8">
              When defective products cause injuries, California law provides strong protections for consumers. Understanding product liability law is essential for holding manufacturers accountable and obtaining compensation for your injuries.
            </p>

            <h2 className="text-3xl font-bold text-gray-900 mt-12 mb-6">Types of Product Defects</h2>
            <p className="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-6">
              Product liability claims involve three main types of defects:
            </p>
            <ul className="list-disc pl-6 mb-6 text-gray-700 space-y-3">
              <li><strong>Design Defects:</strong> Flaws in the product's design that make it inherently dangerous, even when manufactured correctly. The entire product line is defective (e.g., vehicles prone to rollovers, tools without safety guards)</li>
              <li><strong>Manufacturing Defects:</strong> Errors during production that make specific products dangerous, though the design is safe. Only some products are defective (e.g., contaminated medication, improperly assembled machinery)</li>
              <li><strong>Marketing Defects (Failure to Warn):</strong> Inadequate instructions, warnings, or labels about product risks. The product may be safe if used correctly, but lacks proper guidance (e.g., missing side effect warnings, inadequate safety instructions)</li>
            </ul>

            <h2 className="text-3xl font-bold text-gray-900 mt-12 mb-6">Common Defective Products</h2>
            <p className="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-6">
              Dangerous products frequently causing injuries include:
            </p>
            <ul className="list-disc pl-6 mb-6 text-gray-700 space-y-3">
              <li><strong>Vehicles:</strong> Defective airbags, brake failures, accelerator problems, tire blowouts</li>
              <li><strong>Medical Devices:</strong> Hip implants, pacemakers, surgical mesh, IVC filters</li>
              <li><strong>Pharmaceuticals:</strong> Dangerous medications, contaminated drugs, inadequate warnings</li>
              <li><strong>Consumer Products:</strong> Toys with choking hazards, cribs with entrapment risks, exploding electronics</li>
              <li><strong>Power Tools:</strong> Saws without blade guards, grinders causing kickback, nail guns misfiring</li>
              <li><strong>Household Appliances:</strong> Washing machines catching fire, dryers igniting, space heaters overheating</li>
              <li><strong>Children's Products:</strong> Car seats, strollers, high chairs with structural failures</li>
              <li><strong>Recreational Equipment:</strong> ATVs prone to rollover, defective helmets, faulty climbing gear</li>
            </ul>

            <h2 className="text-3xl font-bold text-gray-900 mt-12 mb-6">Strict Liability in California</h2>
            <p className="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-6">
              California applies strict liability to product defect cases. This means you don't need to prove the manufacturer was negligentâ€”only that:
            </p>
            <ul className="list-disc pl-6 mb-6 text-gray-700 space-y-3">
              <li>The product had a defect when it left the manufacturer</li>
              <li>The defect made the product unreasonably dangerous</li>
              <li>You were injured while using the product in a reasonably foreseeable manner</li>
              <li>The defect was a substantial factor in causing your injury</li>
            </ul>
            <p className="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-6">
              This legal standard makes it easier for injured consumers to recover damages compared to traditional negligence claims.
            </p>

            <h2 className="text-3xl font-bold text-gray-900 mt-12 mb-6">Who Can Be Held Liable?</h2>
            <p className="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-6">
              Multiple parties in the distribution chain may be responsible:
            </p>
            <ul className="list-disc pl-6 mb-6 text-gray-700 space-y-3">
              <li><strong>Manufacturers:</strong> Companies that designed and produced the product</li>
              <li><strong>Component Part Manufacturers:</strong> Makers of defective parts used in the final product</li>
              <li><strong>Wholesalers:</strong> Companies that distribute products to retailers</li>
              <li><strong>Retailers:</strong> Stores that sold the defective product to consumers</li>
              <li><strong>Importers:</strong> Companies bringing foreign-made products into the U.S.</li>
            </ul>
            <p className="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-6">
              You can pursue claims against multiple defendants to maximize your chances of recovery.
            </p>

            <h2 className="text-3xl font-bold text-gray-900 mt-12 mb-6">Proving a Product Liability Claim</h2>
            <p className="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-6">
              Strong cases require comprehensive evidence:
            </p>
            <ul className="list-disc pl-6 mb-6 text-gray-700 space-y-3">
              <li><strong>The Product:</strong> Preserve the defective item in its post-accident condition</li>
              <li><strong>Packaging and Instructions:</strong> Keep all original materials, warnings, and manuals</li>
              <li><strong>Purchase Records:</strong> Receipts showing when and where you bought the product</li>
              <li><strong>Medical Records:</strong> Documentation of injuries and treatment</li>
              <li><strong>Expert Analysis:</strong> Engineers or specialists who can identify the defect</li>
              <li><strong>Similar Incidents:</strong> Reports of other injuries from the same product</li>
              <li><strong>Photos and Videos:</strong> Visual evidence of the defect and accident scene</li>
              <li><strong>Witness Statements:</strong> Testimony about how the accident occurred</li>
            </ul>

            <h2 className="text-3xl font-bold text-gray-900 mt-12 mb-6">Product Recalls and Your Rights</h2>
            <p className="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-6">
              If a product is recalled:
            </p>
            <ul className="list-disc pl-6 mb-6 text-gray-700 space-y-3">
              <li>The recall strengthens your liability claim by proving the manufacturer knew of the defect</li>
              <li>You may still file a lawsuit even if you ignored the recall</li>
              <li>Injuries occurring before the recall announcement are especially strong cases</li>
              <li>The recall notice can serve as evidence of the defect</li>
              <li>Post-recall injuries may still be compensable if warnings were inadequate</li>
            </ul>

            <h2 className="text-3xl font-bold text-gray-900 mt-12 mb-6">Damages in Product Liability Cases</h2>
            <p className="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-6">
              Victims may recover:
            </p>
            <ul className="list-disc pl-6 mb-6 text-gray-700 space-y-3">
              <li><strong>Economic Damages:</strong> Medical bills, lost wages, future treatment costs, diminished earning capacity</li>
              <li><strong>Non-Economic Damages:</strong> Pain and suffering, emotional distress, loss of enjoyment of life, disfigurement</li>
              <li><strong>Punitive Damages:</strong> In cases of willful misconduct or fraud, additional damages to punish the manufacturer</li>
              <li><strong>Wrongful Death Damages:</strong> Funeral costs, loss of financial support, loss of companionship for surviving family</li>
            </ul>

            <h2 className="text-3xl font-bold text-gray-900 mt-12 mb-6">Defenses Manufacturers May Use</h2>
            <p className="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-6">
              Common defenses include:
            </p>
            <ul className="list-disc pl-6 mb-6 text-gray-700 space-y-3">
              <li><strong>Product Alteration:</strong> Claiming you modified the product after purchase</li>
              <li><strong>Misuse:</strong> Arguing you used the product in an unforeseeable way</li>
              <li><strong>Assumption of Risk:</strong> Asserting you knowingly used a dangerous product</li>
              <li><strong>Comparative Fault:</strong> Claiming you were partially responsible for your injuries</li>
              <li><strong>Statute of Limitations:</strong> Arguing your claim was filed too late</li>
            </ul>

            <h2 className="text-3xl font-bold text-gray-900 mt-12 mb-6">Class Actions vs. Individual Claims</h2>
            <p className="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-6">
              When many people are injured by the same defective product:
            </p>
            <ul className="list-disc pl-6 mb-6 text-gray-700 space-y-3">
              <li><strong>Class Action Lawsuits:</strong> Group all similar claims together, efficient for widespread harm with similar injuries, but typically lower individual recovery</li>
              <li><strong>Individual Lawsuits:</strong> Pursue your own case, better for severe or unique injuries, allows for maximum compensation based on your specific damages</li>
              <li><strong>Mass Tort Litigation:</strong> Coordinates similar cases while maintaining individual claims, combines efficiency with personalized recovery</li>
            </ul>

            <h2 className="text-3xl font-bold text-gray-900 mt-12 mb-6">Consumer Product Safety Commission (CPSC)</h2>
            <p className="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-6">
              The CPSC oversees consumer product safety:
            </p>
            <ul className="list-disc pl-6 mb-6 text-gray-700 space-y-3">
              <li>Issues recalls of dangerous products</li>
              <li>Maintains database of consumer complaints and injuries</li>
              <li>Conducts safety testing and investigations</li>
              <li>Reports can be used as evidence in liability cases</li>
              <li>You can report dangerous products at SaferProducts.gov</li>
            </ul>

            <h2 className="text-3xl font-bold text-gray-900 mt-12 mb-6">Steps to Take After a Product Injury</h2>
            <p className="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-6">
              Protect your claim by:
            </p>
            <ul className="list-disc pl-6 mb-6 text-gray-700 space-y-3">
              <li>Seeking immediate medical attention</li>
              <li>Preserving the product exactly as it was after the accident</li>
              <li>Keeping all packaging, instructions, and receipts</li>
              <li>Documenting the scene with photos and videos</li>
              <li>Reporting the incident to the CPSC</li>
              <li>Not returning the product to the manufacturer</li>
              <li>Gathering contact information from witnesses</li>
              <li>Consulting an attorney before speaking with manufacturers or insurers</li>
            </ul>

            <h2 className="text-3xl font-bold text-gray-900 mt-12 mb-6">Statute of Limitations</h2>
            <p className="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-6">
              California generally allows two years from the date of injury to file a product liability lawsuit. However, there's also a "discovery rule" that may extend this deadline if the defect or injury wasn't immediately apparent. For wrongful death claims, the time limit is two years from the date of death.
            </p>
