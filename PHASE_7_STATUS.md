3. **Camp Lejeune** - Active settlement program
4. **Benzene** - Chemical exposure cases

### Priority 3: Specialized Areas
Complete the remaining calculators based on firm specialties

## üõ†Ô∏è Implementation Template

For each calculator, follow this pattern (based on completed calculators):

```typescript
// 1. Define severity/type multipliers
const severityMultipliers = {
  'mild': 1,
  'moderate': 2,
  'severe': 4,
  'catastrophic': 8
};

// 2. Calculate base amounts
let baseMin = 50000;
let baseMax = 250000;

// 3. Apply multipliers
baseMin *= severityMultiplier;
baseMax *= severityMultiplier;

// 4. Add actual costs
baseMin += medicalCosts;
baseMax += medicalCosts * 2;

// 5. Add lost wages
baseMin += wages * yearsImpacted * 0.8;
baseMax += wages * yearsImpacted * 1.5;

// 6. Apply special factors
if (permanentDisability) {
  baseMin *= 1.5;
  baseMax *= 2.0;
}
```
