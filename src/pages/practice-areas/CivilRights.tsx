  const faqData = [
    {
      question: "How much does a civil rights attorney cost?",
      answer: "We work on contingency fees, meaning you pay nothing unless we win your case. When we win, our fee comes from the settlement or verdict, not your pocket. This ensures everyone has access to justice regardless of financial resources."
    },
    {
      question: "How long do I have to file a civil rights lawsuit?",
      answer: "California has different deadlines depending on the type of claim. Government entities require a claim within 6 months, while federal Section 1983 claims have a 2-year statute of limitations. Time is critical - contact us immediately."
    },
    {
      question: "What is Section 1983 and how does it help my case?",
      answer: "42 U.S.C. ยง 1983 allows you to sue government officials who violate your constitutional rights. This powerful federal law provides remedies for police brutality, false arrest, and other civil rights violations, including attorney fees when you win."
    },
    {
      question: "Can I sue if I was resisting arrest?",
      answer: "Yes. Even if you resisted, officers can only use reasonable force necessary to overcome resistance. Excessive force remains illegal. Many 'resisting' charges are fabricated to justify officer misconduct - we investigate thoroughly."
    },
    {
      question: "What damages can I recover in a civil rights case?",
      answer: "You can recover medical expenses, lost wages, emotional distress, pain and suffering, and punitive damages. Attorney fees are also recoverable under civil rights laws. Damages often reach hundreds of thousands or millions for serious violations."
    },
    {
      question: "Will suing police put me in danger?",
      answer: "Retaliation is illegal and creates additional claims. We take protective measures when necessary and document any harassment. Courts take retaliation seriously, often increasing damages significantly."
    },
    {
      question: "Do I need video evidence to win my case?",
      answer: "Video helps but isn't required. We build strong cases using medical records, witness testimony, officer statements, and circumstantial evidence. Even when police delete or hide video, we pursue sanctions and adverse inferences."
    },
    {
      question: "What is qualified immunity?",
      answer: "A legal doctrine protecting government officials from lawsuits unless they violated 'clearly established' rights. While challenging, experienced attorneys know how to overcome qualified immunity through proper legal strategies and case law."
    },
    {
      question: "Can I sue a city or county for police misconduct?",
      answer: "Yes, under Monell claims when municipal policies, customs, or practices caused the violation. This includes inadequate training, supervision, or discipline. Municipal liability often results in larger settlements."
    },
    {
      question: "What if the officer was fired or criminally charged?",
      answer: "Criminal prosecution and employment consequences are separate from civil rights. You can pursue civil damages regardless of criminal outcomes. In fact, officer discipline often strengthens civil cases."
    },
    {
      question: "How long does a civil rights case take?",
      answer: "Cases typically resolve within 12-24 months, though complex cases may take longer. We balance urgency with maximizing compensation. Some cases settle quickly while others require litigation for fair results."
    },
    {
      question: "What is the Tom Bane Civil Rights Act?",
      answer: "California's powerful civil rights law (Civil Code ยง 52.1) providing broader protections than federal law. It covers threats, intimidation, or coercion interfering with constitutional rights, with minimum $4,000 damages and attorney fees."
    },
    {
      question: "Can I record police in California?",
      answer: "Yes. You have a First Amendment right to record police performing public duties. Officers cannot legally stop you from recording or seize your phone without a warrant. Recording is crucial evidence."
    },
    {
      question: "What if I was drunk or on drugs during the incident?",
      answer: "Intoxication doesn't forfeit constitutional rights. Officers still cannot use excessive force or make unlawful arrests. While intoxication may affect damages, you still have valid civil rights claims."
    },
    {
      question: "Do I have to cooperate with internal affairs investigations?",
      answer: "No. You're not required to speak with police investigators. Anything you say can be used against you in criminal and civil proceedings. Always consult an attorney before giving statements."
    },
    {
      question: "What if the incident wasn't that serious?",
      answer: "Any constitutional violation is serious. Even brief detentions, minor injuries, or threats can result in significant damages. Civil rights laws protect all citizens from government overreach, regardless of severity."
    },
    {
      question: "Can I sue for emotional trauma without physical injuries?",
      answer: "Yes. Psychological injuries like PTSD, anxiety, and depression are compensable damages. Mental health treatment documents these injuries. Emotional distress awards often exceed physical injury compensation."
    },
    {
      question: "What evidence should I preserve?",
      answer: "Photograph injuries immediately, preserve clothing, get witness contact information, request medical treatment, and document everything. Don't wash wounds before photographing. Time-sensitive evidence disappears quickly."
    },
    {
      question: "Will my case become public?",
      answer: "Court filings are public records, but we can request protective orders for sensitive information. Many cases settle confidentially. We balance your privacy concerns with achieving maximum compensation."
    },
    {
      question: "What if multiple officers were involved?",
      answer: "Each officer faces individual liability for their actions. Those who participated, encouraged, or failed to intervene can all be held responsible. Multiple defendants often increase settlement values."
    },
    {
      question: "Can family members sue for police brutality?",
      answer: "Spouses and children can sue for loss of consortium and companionship when family members are injured or killed by police. Family members often suffer secondary trauma requiring compensation."
    },
    {
      question: "What if the incident happened in jail or prison?",
      answer: "Inmates retain constitutional rights. Excessive force, medical neglect, and failure to protect violate Eighth and Fourteenth Amendments. Prison officials face liability for deliberate indifference to serious risks."
    },
    {
      question: "Do I need expert witnesses?",
      answer: "Often yes. Use of force experts, medical professionals, and economists provide crucial testimony. We work with nationally recognized experts and advance all costs so you pay nothing upfront."
    },
    {
      question: "What if police claim I was reaching for a weapon?",
      answer: "Officers often fabricate weapons threats to justify excessive force. We investigate thoroughly, examining evidence and witness statements. False police reports strengthen misconduct claims significantly."
    },
    {
      question: "Can I sue for strip searches?",
      answer: "Unreasonable strip searches violate Fourth Amendment rights. Searches without reasonable suspicion, in public view, or conducted improperly create liability. Particularly strong claims for minor offenses."
    },
    {
      question: "What if I signed something at the jail?",
      answer: "Documents signed under duress, without understanding, or containing false information may be challenged. Don't assume signed papers bar claims. We review all documents for validity and defenses."
    },
    {
      question: "Will insurance cover the judgment against police?",
      answer: "Government entities typically have insurance for officer conduct within policy. However, punitive damages and intentional acts may not be covered, creating personal liability pressure for settlement."
    },
    {
      question: "What if the officer has no money?",
      answer: "Government entities typically indemnify officers, meaning the city/county pays judgments. We pursue all available resources including insurance policies, government funds, and personal assets when appropriate."
    },
    {
      question: "Can undocumented immigrants sue police?",
      answer: "Yes. Constitutional protections apply to all persons in the U.S. regardless of immigration status. You can pursue civil rights claims without fear of deportation solely for seeking justice."
    },
    {
      question: "What if I have a criminal record?",
      answer: "Past criminal history doesn't forfeit constitutional rights. While it may affect some damages, you still have valid civil rights claims. Officers cannot use your history to justify current misconduct."
    },
    {
      question: "How do you prove racial profiling?",
      answer: "Through statistical evidence, comparative treatment, officer statements, and departmental patterns. California's RIPA Act requires data collection showing disparate treatment. We use sophisticated legal strategies to prove discrimination."
    },
    {
      question: "What is deliberate indifference in medical care?",
      answer: "When officials know of and disregard serious medical needs. Includes denying medication, ignoring symptoms, delaying treatment, and inadequate mental health care. Violates Eighth/Fourteenth Amendment rights."
    },
    {
      question: "Can I sue school police who hurt my child?",
      answer: "Yes. School resource officers who use excessive force or violate students' rights face liability. Minors have special protections, and school districts may share liability for inadequate policies or supervision."
    },
    {
      question: "What if officers turned off body cameras?",
      answer: "Deliberately disabling cameras suggests consciousness of guilt. Courts may instruct juries to assume officers had something to hide. Policy violations strengthen misconduct claims even without footage."
    },
    {
      question: "Can I get punitive damages against police?",
      answer: "Yes, for malicious, oppressive, or reckless conduct. Punitive damages punish wrongdoers and deter future misconduct. Not covered by insurance, creating personal liability pressure for officers."
    },
    {
      question: "What if I was injured during a high-speed chase?",
      answer: "Officers have limited immunity during pursuits, but reckless conduct shocking the conscience creates liability. Innocent bystanders injured by pursuits have stronger claims than fleeing suspects."
    },
    {
      question: "Will my immigration status be reported?",
      answer: "We don't report clients to immigration authorities. Attorney-client privilege protects our communications. Civil rights violations are entirely separate from immigration matters."
    },
    {
      question: "What if multiple agencies were involved?",
      answer: "Each agency and officer faces potential liability for their actions. Joint operations often involve federal, state, and local agencies, all potentially responsible for constitutional violations."
    },
    {
      question: "Can I sue for tasering?",
      answer: "Excessive taser use violates Fourth Amendment when force exceeds necessity. Multiple deployments, tasering restrained individuals, or using tasers on vulnerable populations strengthens liability claims."
    },
    {
      question: "What is Brady material in criminal cases?",
      answer: "Evidence favorable to defendants that prosecutors must disclose. When police or prosecutors hide exculpatory evidence, it violates due process and can lead to civil rights claims for resulting harm."
    },
    {
      question: "How do you calculate damages?",
      answer: "We evaluate medical expenses, lost wages, pain and suffering, emotional distress, and future impacts. Economic experts calculate lifetime losses while medical experts document ongoing treatment needs."
    },
    {
      question: "What if the incident was captured on surveillance?",
      answer: "Video evidence is powerful but requires preservation. We immediately send preservation notices to prevent deletion. Surveillance footage often contradicts police reports, strengthening misconduct claims."
    },
    {
      question: "Can I sue for wrongful conviction?",
      answer: "Yes, if police misconduct led to false conviction. This includes fabricating evidence, coercing confessions, or hiding exculpatory evidence. Compensation increases with years wrongfully imprisoned."
    },
    {
      question: "What if I was protesting when arrested?",
      answer: "Peaceful protesters have First and Fourth Amendment protections. Mass arrests without individualized probable cause, excessive force against non-violent demonstrators, and content-based targeting violate civil rights."
    },
    {
      question: "Will I have to testify at trial?",
      answer: "Most cases settle without trial. If trial is necessary, we prepare you thoroughly and protect your interests. Your testimony is crucial but we make the experience as comfortable as possible."
    },
    {
      question: "What makes a civil rights case strong?",
      answer: "Clear evidence of violations, documented injuries, witness support, video footage, officer misconduct history, policy violations, and inconsistent police statements. We build strong cases even without ideal evidence."
    },
    {
      question: "Should I accept the first settlement offer?",
      answer: "Never without attorney review. Initial offers are always lowball attempts. We know true case values and negotiate aggressively. Most cases settle for multiples of initial offers through skilled advocacy."
    },
    {
      question: "What if I'm afraid of retaliation?",
      answer: "Retaliation for exercising legal rights is illegal and creates additional claims. We can seek protective orders if necessary. Document any harassment - it strengthens your case and increases damages."
    },
    {
      question: "Can I sue for false arrest if charges were dropped?",
      answer: "Yes. Dropped charges often indicate lack of probable cause for arrest. While not conclusive proof, dismissed charges strengthen false arrest claims and suggest prosecutorial doubt about case merit."
    },
    {
      question: "What is positional asphyxia?",
      answer: "Death or injury from being placed in positions restricting breathing, like prolonged prone restraint. Despite known dangers, officers continue using these techniques, creating clear liability for resulting harm."
    },
    {
      question: "How do you handle media attention?",
      answer: "We manage media strategically to benefit your case while protecting privacy. Positive publicity can pressure settlements while negative coverage requires careful response. We control the narrative professionally."
    },
    {
      question: "What if police deleted evidence?",
      answer: "Destroying evidence (spoliation) leads to sanctions, adverse jury instructions, and separate claims. Courts presume deleted evidence was unfavorable to police. We pursue all remedies for evidence tampering."

                    <p>
                      Civil rights cases in California involve complex federal and state laws, constitutional principles, and government liability theories. Our firm has the resources and expertise to handle every aspect of your case, from investigating the incident to working with experts who can clearly explain how your rights were violated.
                    </p>
                    
                    <p>
                      California's civil rights laws provide some of the strongest protections in the nation. We pursue claims under federal Section 1983, California's Tom Bane Civil Rights Act, and other applicable statutes to maximize your recovery and ensure accountability.
                    </p>
                    
                    <p>
                      We investigate every aspect of your case to ensure no responsible party escapes accountability. This comprehensive approach often results in higher compensation as we identify multiple defendants and pursue claims through various legal channels including municipal liability, individual officer liability, and policy reform.

                        <p>Police brutality represents the most visible form of civil rights violations, encompassing any use of force beyond what is reasonably necessary to accomplish a lawful police purpose. This includes physical beatings with batons, fists, or other objects; excessive use of tasers or pepper spray; chokeholds and other dangerous restraint techniques; and unjustified deadly force incidents.</p>
                        
                        <p>California's recent legislative changes have strengthened protections against police brutality. Assembly Bill 392 requires that officers use only force that is "necessary" rather than merely "reasonable," raising the standard for justified force. This means officers must consider whether force is required at all, not just whether their actions might be deemed reasonable by other officers.</p>
                        
                        <p>The consequences of police brutality extend far beyond physical injuries. Victims often suffer severe psychological trauma including PTSD, anxiety, depression, and loss of trust in law enforcement. Many require ongoing medical treatment, therapy, and rehabilitation. The financial impact includes medical bills, lost wages, and diminished earning capacity.</p>

                        <p>False arrest occurs when police detain or arrest someone without probable cause, violating the Fourth Amendment's protection against unreasonable seizures.

                        <p>California's Racial and Identity Profiling Act (RIPA) requires law enforcement agencies to collect and report data on stops, searches, and interactions.

                        <p>Pretextual stops represent a common form of racial profiling where officers use minor traffic violations as excuses to investigate drivers based on race. "Driving while Black" or "Driving while Brown" aren't crimes, yet minorities face constant scrutiny and harassment.</p>

                      <h3>Understanding Your Legal Rights</h3>
                      <p>
                        Civil rights cases involve complex federal and state laws designed to protect constitutional freedoms. The primary federal remedy is Section 1983, which allows lawsuits against government officials who violate constitutional rights while acting under color of state law.
                      </p>
                      
                      <h4>Government Claim Requirements</h4>
                      <p>
                        California requires filing a government claim within 6 months for state law violations against government entities. This administrative requirement must be completed before filing a lawsuit. Federal Section 1983 claims don't require this step but pursuing both maximizes recovery options.
                      </p>
                      
                      <h4>Municipal Liability</h4>
                      <p>
                        Cities and counties can be held liable under Monell claims when policies, customs, or practices cause constitutional violations. This includes inadequate training, supervision, or discipline that amounts to deliberate indifference to constitutional rights.
