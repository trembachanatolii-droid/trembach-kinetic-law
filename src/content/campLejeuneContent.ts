        content: `From 1953 to 1987, over one million Marines, their families, and civilian workers at Camp Lejeune, North Carolina, were unknowingly exposed to drinking water contaminated with dangerous industrial solvents and chemicals. This represents one of the worst water contamination disasters in United States history.

The contamination originated from multiple sources across the base:
‚Ä¢ ABC One-Hour Cleaners: An off-base dry cleaning facility that improperly disposed of cleaning solvents, contaminating the Tarawa Terrace water system with perchloroethylene (PCE)
‚Ä¢ Leaking Underground Storage Tanks: Fuel storage facilities at Hadnot Point leaked thousands of gallons of gasoline containing benzene into the groundwater
‚Ä¢ Industrial Area Spills: Improper disposal of degreasers and solvents used for cleaning military equipment
‚Ä¢ Waste Disposal Sites: Multiple dumps and disposal areas where chemicals were improperly stored or buried

Testing revealed four primary contaminants at dangerous levels:
‚Ä¢ Trichloroethylene (TCE): Up to 1,400 parts per billion (ppb) - 280 times the safe level
‚Ä¢ Perchloroethylene (PCE): Up to 215 ppb - 43 times the safe level
‚Ä¢ Benzene: Up to 380 ppb - 76 times the safe level
‚Ä¢ Vinyl Chloride: Detected at various dangerous concentrations

Perhaps most shocking is that Marine Corps officials knew about the contamination as early as 1980 but failed to shut down the contaminated wells until 1985. Internal documents reveal that officials downplayed the risks and delayed notifying residents. It wasn't until 1999 that the Marine Corps began notifying former residents about their exposure.

Thousands of California veterans who trained at Camp Lejeune during their service are now facing serious health conditions. Many California Marines spent their entire boot camp and advanced training at Camp Lejeune, drinking, cooking with, and bathing in the contaminated water daily. California has one of the highest populations of affected veterans in the nation.`
