    question: "Who can file a Camp Lejeune water contamination claim?",
    answer: "Anyone who lived, worked, or was stationed at Camp Lejeune for at least 30 days between August 1, 1953, and December 31, 1987, can file a claim. This includes Marines, Navy personnel, their family members, civilian employees, and contractors. Children exposed in utero through their mothers are also eligible."
  },
  {
    question: "What health conditions qualify for Camp Lejeune compensation?",
    answer: "Over 70 conditions may qualify, including all cancers (especially bladder, kidney, and liver), Parkinson's disease, leukemia, non-Hodgkin's lymphoma, multiple myeloma, birth defects, infertility, miscarriage, and neurological disorders. Even if your condition isn't on the VA's presumptive list, you may still qualify."
  },
  {
    question: "How much compensation can I receive for a Camp Lejeune claim?",
    answer: "Settlement amounts vary widely based on your condition, age, medical expenses, and other factors. Typical ranges are $150,000-$500,000 for most cancers, $450,000-$1.2 million for Parkinson's disease, and $500,000-$1.5 million for wrongful death cases. Some severe cases may exceed these amounts."
  },
  {
    question: "Is there a deadline to file a Camp Lejeune claim?",
    answer: "The Camp Lejeune Justice Act provides a limited window to file claims. While the initial deadline was August 10, 2024, there may be extensions or exceptions for certain cases. Contact us immediately to determine if you can still file - don't assume it's too late."
  },
  {
    question: "Do I need to prove the water caused my condition?",
    answer: "For the eight presumptive conditions, the connection is already established. For other conditions, we work with medical experts to establish causation. The Camp Lejeune Justice Act has a lower burden of proof than typical toxic exposure cases, making it easier to prove your claim."
  },
  {
    question: "Will filing a claim affect my VA benefits?",
    answer: "Filing a Camp Lejeune claim will not reduce or eliminate your VA benefits. However, any compensation you receive may be offset by VA disability payments you've already received for the same condition. You'll still come out ahead financially with a successful claim."
  },
  {
    question: "What if I don't have my military records?",
    answer: "Don't worry - we can help obtain your military records. We work with the National Personnel Records Center and use various databases to prove your presence at Camp Lejeune. Many veterans have successfully filed claims without having their original paperwork."
  },
  {
    question: "How long does it take to get a Camp Lejeune settlement?",
    answer: "The timeline varies: Elective Option settlements typically take 60-180 days. Traditional litigation takes 12-24 months but may result in significantly higher compensation. Some complex cases may take longer, but we work to expedite every claim."
  },
  {
    question: "What if my loved one died from a Camp Lejeune-related illness?",
    answer: "You can file a wrongful death claim on behalf of your deceased loved one. These claims often result in the highest settlements, typically ranging from $500,000 to over $1.5 million. Surviving spouses, children, and estates can all potentially file claims."
  },
  {
    question: "Can I file if I already received a VA denial?",
    answer: "Yes! A VA denial does not affect your ability to file under the Camp Lejeune Justice Act. This is a completely separate legal process with different standards and requirements. Many veterans denied VA benefits have successfully obtained Camp Lejeune settlements."
  },
  {
    question: "What's the difference between the Elective Option and litigation?",
    answer: "The Elective Option offers faster but lower settlements ($75,000-$150,000) without proving specific causation. Litigation takes longer but can result in much higher compensation ($250,000-$1,500,000+) and includes the right to a jury trial. We help you choose the best path for your situation."
  },
  {
    question: "How much does it cost to hire a Camp Lejeune lawyer?",
    answer: "Nothing upfront. We work on contingency, meaning you pay no fees unless we win. By law, attorney fees are capped at 20% for administrative claims and 25% for court cases - lower than typical personal injury cases. All costs are advanced by our firm."
  },
  {
    question: "Can California residents file Camp Lejeune claims?",
    answer: "Absolutely. Your current residence doesn't matter - only that you were at Camp Lejeune during the contamination period. California has thousands of affected veterans. As a California law firm, we understand local resources and can coordinate with California VA facilities and medical providers."
  },
  {
    question: "What chemicals contaminated the Camp Lejeune water?",
    answer: "The main contaminants were trichloroethylene (TCE), perchloroethylene (PCE), benzene, and vinyl chloride. These industrial solvents and fuel components were present at levels 240 to 3,400 times the safe limits, making Camp Lejeune one of the worst water contamination disasters in U.S. history."
  },
  {
    question: "Which areas of Camp Lejeune were contaminated?",
    answer: "The Tarawa Terrace and Hadnot Point water treatment plants served most of the base, including family housing, barracks, schools, the hospital, and work areas. If you spent time anywhere on the main base area between 1953-1987, you were likely exposed."
  },
  {
    question: "Can I file if I was pregnant at Camp Lejeune?",
    answer: "Yes, pregnant women who were at Camp Lejeune can file claims for their own health issues and for birth defects or conditions in their children. Children exposed in utero have their own right to compensation for birth defects, developmental delays, childhood cancers, and other conditions."
  },
  {
    question: "What if I have multiple conditions from Camp Lejeune?",
    answer: "Having multiple conditions strengthens your claim and typically results in higher compensation. Each condition is evaluated, and you may receive compensation for all Camp Lejeune-related health problems. We ensure all your conditions are properly documented and claimed."
  },
  {
    question: "Do I need to travel to North Carolina for my case?",
    answer: "No, you don't need to travel. While cases are filed in North Carolina federal court, we handle everything remotely. Depositions can be done locally in California, and most cases settle without requiring your physical presence in court."
  },
  {
    question: "What evidence do I need for a Camp Lejeune claim?",
    answer: "Key evidence includes military service records, medical records showing your diagnosis, and any documentation of time at Camp Lejeune. However, don't worry if you're missing documents - we can help obtain records and build your case with available evidence."
  },
  {
    question: "Can civilians who worked at Camp Lejeune file claims?",
    answer: "Yes, civilian employees, contractors, and anyone who worked on base for at least 30 days during the contamination period can file claims. This includes teachers, healthcare workers, maintenance staff, and contractors. The same compensation rules apply to civilians as to military personnel."
  },
  {
    question: "What about Parkinson's disease and Camp Lejeune?",
    answer: "Parkinson's disease is one of the strongest Camp Lejeune claims. Studies show veterans exposed to Camp Lejeune water have a 70% higher risk of developing Parkinson's. These cases often result in settlements of $450,000 to $1.2 million due to the strong scientific link."
  },
  {
    question: "How does the Camp Lejeune Justice Act help victims?",
    answer: "The Camp Lejeune Justice Act removes legal barriers that previously prevented lawsuits, allows jury trials against the government, provides a lower burden of proof, and creates a clear path to compensation. It's the first law allowing civilians and families to sue for Camp Lejeune exposure."
  },
  {
    question: "Are Camp Lejeune settlements taxable?",
    answer: "No, Camp Lejeune settlements for physical injuries or illness are not taxable under federal law. You keep the full amount of your settlement (minus attorney fees). However, any interest earned on the settlement after you receive it may be taxable."
  },
  {
    question: "What if the government denies my administrative claim?",
    answer: "If the Navy denies your administrative claim or doesn't respond within 6 months, you can file a lawsuit in federal court. Many initially denied claims succeed in litigation with proper legal representation. Don't give up if your initial claim is denied."
  },
  {
    question: "Can I get compensation for emotional distress?",
    answer: "Yes, compensation includes both economic damages (medical bills, lost wages) and non-economic damages like pain, suffering, emotional distress, and loss of enjoyment of life. The psychological impact of serious illness is a recognized component of Camp Lejeune settlements."
  },
  {
    question: "What's the connection between benzene and Camp Lejeune cancers?",
    answer: "Benzene, found at levels up to 76 times the safe limit, is a known carcinogen strongly linked to leukemia, multiple myeloma, and other blood cancers. Marines at Camp Lejeune have double the normal rate of ALS and significantly higher rates of various cancers due to benzene exposure."
  },
  {
    question: "How do I know which water system I was exposed to?",
    answer: "We can help determine your exposure based on where you lived or worked on base. The Hadnot Point system served most of the main base, while Tarawa Terrace served family housing areas. Both systems were contaminated, so specific location matters less than being on base during the exposure period."
  },
  {
    question: "What if I only visited Camp Lejeune briefly?",
    answer: "Even brief exposures to the highly contaminated water can cause serious health problems. If you spent at least 30 days total at Camp Lejeune during the contamination period, you may qualify for compensation. Multiple short visits can be combined to meet the 30-day requirement."
  },
  {
    question: "Can I file a claim for anxiety or PTSD related to Camp Lejeune?",
    answer: "While psychological conditions alone may not qualify, if you have a physical condition caused by Camp Lejeune exposure, you can claim compensation for related anxiety, depression, and emotional distress. Mental health impacts are considered part of overall damages."
  },
  {
    question: "What role did ABC One-Hour Cleaners play in the contamination?",
    answer: "ABC One-Hour Cleaners, an off-base dry cleaning facility, improperly disposed of perchloroethylene (PCE) cleaning solvents that contaminated the Tarawa Terrace water system. This civilian business was a major source of the toxic contamination that affected thousands of military families."
  },
  {
    question: "How were the underground fuel tanks involved?",
    answer: "Leaking underground storage tanks at Hadnot Point released thousands of gallons of gasoline containing benzene into the groundwater. These fuel leaks were a primary source of benzene contamination, which is strongly linked to blood cancers and other serious health conditions."
  },
  {
    question: "What compensation is available for infertility or miscarriage?",
    answer: "Women who experienced infertility, miscarriages, or other reproductive problems after Camp Lejeune exposure can file claims. These cases typically result in settlements of $75,000-$300,000 depending on the severity and impact on family planning."
  },
  {
    question: "Can children born with birth defects file their own claims?",
    answer: "Yes, children exposed in utero have their own independent right to compensation for birth defects, developmental delays, childhood cancers, and other conditions. These claims are separate from their mothers' claims and can result in substantial settlements."
  },
  {
    question: "What's the difference between presumptive and non-presumptive conditions?",
    answer: "The VA recognizes eight presumptive conditions where the link to Camp Lejeune is already established. For non-presumptive conditions, we must prove the connection with medical evidence. However, the Camp Lejeune Justice Act makes this easier than typical toxic exposure cases."
  },
  {
    question: "How does California law affect my Camp Lejeune claim?",
    answer: "While Camp Lejeune claims are filed under federal law, California's strong consumer protection laws and our state's experience with toxic exposure cases provide additional strategic advantages. California courts have also been favorable to veterans in related cases."
  },
  {
    question: "What if I was at Camp Lejeune as a dependent child?",
    answer: "Children who lived at Camp Lejeune as dependents of military personnel have the same rights as service members. Many childhood cancers, developmental delays, and other conditions in former Camp Lejeune children are now linked to the water contamination."
  },
  {
    question: "Can I file if I worked at the base hospital or schools?",
    answer: "Yes, anyone who worked on base for at least 30 days during the contamination period can file claims. Hospital workers, teachers, and other civilian employees were exposed to the same contaminated water and have equal rights to compensation."
  },
  {
    question: "What about exposure through bathing and cooking?",
    answer: "The contaminated water was used for all purposes - drinking, cooking, bathing, and cleaning. Exposure occurred through ingestion, inhalation of vapors during hot showers, and skin absorption. All forms of contact with the contaminated water systems contributed to toxic exposure."
  },
  {
    question: "How do I prove I was at Camp Lejeune if I don't have records?",
    answer: "We can help obtain proof through military personnel records, unit histories, housing records, school enrollment records for children, employment records for civilians, and witness statements. There are multiple ways to establish your presence at Camp Lejeune."
  },
  {
    question: "What's the statute of limitations for Camp Lejeune claims?",
    answer: "The Camp Lejeune Justice Act provides a specific filing window that extends traditional statute of limitations rules. The exact deadline depends on when your condition was diagnosed and other factors. Contact us immediately to determine your specific deadline."
  },
  {
    question: "Can I file multiple claims for different family members?",
    answer: "Yes, each affected family member can file their own claim. A veteran might file for their cancer, their spouse for their condition, and their children for birth defects or childhood illnesses. Each person's claim is evaluated separately."
  },
  {
    question: "What if my condition developed decades after leaving Camp Lejeune?",
    answer: "This is typical for toxic exposure cases. Many Camp Lejeune-related cancers and conditions don't develop until 10-40 years after exposure. The long latency period is well-documented and doesn't prevent you from filing a successful claim."
  },
  {
    question: "How do attorneys' fees work in Camp Lejeune cases?",
    answer: "Attorney fees are capped by federal law at 20% for administrative claims and 25% for litigation. This is lower than typical personal injury cases. You pay nothing unless we win, and all case expenses are advanced by our firm at no cost to you."
  },
  {
    question: "What makes Camp Lejeune different from other toxic exposure cases?",
    answer: "The Camp Lejeune Justice Act specifically allows lawsuits against the federal government, which normally has sovereign immunity. It also provides a lower burden of proof and specific procedures designed to help victims obtain compensation more easily than typical toxic exposure cases."
  },
  {
    question: "Can I file if I'm currently receiving VA benefits for another condition?",
    answer: "Yes, receiving VA benefits for other conditions doesn't prevent you from filing a Camp Lejeune claim. However, you cannot receive double compensation for the same condition. Any Camp Lejeune settlement may be reduced by VA payments already received for the same illness."
  },
  {
    question: "What should I do first if I think I have a Camp Lejeune claim?",
    answer: "Contact an experienced Camp Lejeune attorney immediately to discuss your case. We'll help determine if you qualify, gather necessary evidence, and file your claim before any deadlines. The sooner you start, the better we can document your case and maximize your compensation."
  },
  {
    question: "How is Camp Lejeune different from other military base contaminations?",
    answer: "Camp Lejeune is unique because Congress passed specific legislation (the Camp Lejeune Justice Act) allowing victims to sue the federal government. The contamination was also exceptionally severe - chemicals were present at levels up to 3,400 times the safe limits for over 30 years."
  },
  {
    question: "What role did the Marine Corps play in covering up the contamination?",
    answer: "Internal documents show Marine Corps officials knew about the contamination as early as 1980 but failed to close contaminated wells until 1985. They also delayed notifying affected personnel until 1999 - 14 years after the wells were finally closed. This cover-up strengthens victims' claims for punitive damages."
  },
  {
    question: "Can I still file if I've already started a VA claim for the same condition?",
    answer: "Yes, you can pursue both a VA claim and a Camp Lejeune claim simultaneously. They are separate processes with different requirements and benefits. However, any compensation received may be coordinated to prevent double recovery for the same damages."
