            The moments immediately following an accident prove critical for protecting both your physical wellbeing and legal rights. Knowing exactly what to do—and what to avoid—can significantly impact your ability to obtain fair compensation for injuries and damages. This comprehensive guide covers essential steps every accident victim should take.
          </p>

          <h2 className="text-3xl font-bold mt-12 mb-6 text-gray-900">Ensure Safety First</h2>
          <p className="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-6">
            Check yourself and passengers for injuries immediately. Even if you feel fine, adrenaline can mask serious trauma including internal injuries, concussions, and fractures. Move to a safe location only if you can do so without risking further injury. If vehicles are drivable and creating traffic hazards, move them to roadside shoulders while awaiting police.
          </p>
          <p className="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-6">
            Turn on hazard lights and set up warning triangles or flares if available. These precautions prevent additional collisions and protect everyone at the scene. Never leave the accident scene before police arrive and complete their investigation, as leaving can result in hit-and-run charges regardless of fault.
          </p>

          <h2 className="text-3xl font-bold mt-12 mb-6 text-gray-900">Call 911 Immediately</h2>
          <p className="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-6">
            Always call 911 after accidents, even seemingly minor ones. Police reports create official records documenting accident circumstances, party information, and preliminary fault determinations. These reports become foundational evidence for insurance claims and potential litigation. Some injuries don't manifest immediately, making police documentation essential.
          </p>
          <p className="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-6">
            Request emergency medical evaluation even if injuries seem minor. Paramedics can identify serious conditions requiring immediate treatment. Their assessment creates medical documentation linking injuries to accidents, countering insurance company arguments that injuries occurred elsewhere or weren't accident-related.
          </p>

          <h2 className="text-3xl font-bold mt-12 mb-6 text-gray-900">Document Everything</h2>
          <p className="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-6">
            Photograph accident scenes from multiple angles capturing vehicle damage, skid marks, traffic signals, road conditions, debris patterns, and visible injuries. Time-stamped photos prove conditions existed at accident times. Take wide shots showing overall scene context and close-ups highlighting specific damage or hazards.
          </p>
          <p className="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-6">
            Obtain contact information from all parties involved including names, phone numbers, addresses, driver's license numbers, insurance information, and vehicle details. Never accept verbal insurance promises—insist on seeing insurance cards and documenting policy information.
          </p>
          <p className="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-6">
            Identify and interview witnesses immediately. Witnesses often leave scenes quickly, so obtain names, phone numbers, and brief statements about what they observed. Witness testimony proves crucial when parties dispute accident circumstances or fault.
          </p>

          <h2 className="text-3xl font-bold mt-12 mb-6 text-gray-900">What NOT to Do</h2>
          <p className="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-6">
            Never admit fault or apologize at accident scenes. Simple statements like "I'm sorry" can be interpreted as fault admissions and used against you. Limit communication with other parties to basic information exchange. Let police and insurance companies determine fault based on evidence.
          </p>
          <p className="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-6">
            Don't discuss accident details on social media. Insurance companies monitor social media accounts looking for posts contradicting injury claims. Seemingly innocent posts about activities can be twisted to argue injuries weren't serious. Maintain strict social media silence regarding accidents.
          </p>
          <p className="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-6">
            Refuse to sign anything at accident scenes except police reports. Other parties or their insurance representatives may ask you to sign statements or releases. Never sign documents without attorney review, as these can waive your legal rights.
          </p>

          <h2 className="text-3xl font-bold mt-12 mb-6 text-gray-900">Seek Medical Treatment</h2>
          <p className="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-6">
            Visit emergency rooms or urgent care facilities immediately after accidents, even without obvious injuries. Many serious conditions including concussions, internal bleeding, and soft tissue damage don't cause immediate symptoms. Delayed medical evaluation allows insurance companies to argue injuries weren't accident-related.
          </p>
          <p className="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-6">
            Follow all treatment recommendations precisely. Attend every appointment, complete prescribed therapies, and take medications as directed. Gaps in treatment suggest injuries weren't serious and undermine compensation claims. If you cannot afford treatment, discuss this with attorneys who can arrange medical care on lien basis.
          </p>

          <h2 className="text-3xl font-bold mt-12 mb-6 text-gray-900">Report to Insurance</h2>
          <p className="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-6">
            Notify your insurance company promptly as policies require immediate or near-immediate reporting. However, provide only basic information—accident date, time, location, and parties involved. Avoid detailed discussions of fault, injuries, or accident specifics without attorney guidance.
          </p>
          <p className="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-6">
            Never provide recorded statements to other parties' insurance companies without attorney consultation. These statements aim to create inconsistencies or admissions undermining your claims. Insurance adjusters ask leading questions designed to elicit harmful responses.
          </p>

          <h2 className="text-3xl font-bold mt-12 mb-6 text-gray-900">Preserve Evidence</h2>
          <p className="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-6">
            Maintain damaged vehicles in their post-accident condition until insurance inspections complete. Don't authorize repairs until adjusters photograph and evaluate damage. Once vehicles are repaired, crucial evidence disappears forever. Similarly, preserve damaged clothing and personal items.
          </p>
          <p className="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-6">
            Keep detailed records of all accident-related expenses including medical bills, prescription costs, vehicle repair estimates, rental car charges, and lost wage documentation. Organize receipts chronologically and maintain copies of all documents. This documentation proves essential for maximizing compensation.
          </p>

          <h2 className="text-3xl font-bold mt-12 mb-6 text-gray-900">Contact an Attorney</h2>
          <p className="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-6">
            Consult personal injury attorneys immediately after serious accidents. Early legal representation protects your rights, ensures proper evidence preservation, and prevents costly mistakes. Attorneys handle insurance company communications, allowing you to focus on recovery.
          </p>
          <p className="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-6">
            Most personal injury attorneys offer free consultations and work on contingency fees—you pay nothing unless they win your case. This arrangement provides access to experienced legal representation regardless of financial circumstances. Don't let concerns about attorney costs prevent seeking legal advice.
          </p>

          <h2 className="text-3xl font-bold mt-12 mb-6 text-gray-900">Special Considerations</h2>
          <p className="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-6">
            Hit-and-run accidents require immediate police reporting and notification to your insurance company. Uninsured motorist coverage typically covers hit-and-run accidents, but strict procedural requirements apply. Failing to report promptly can jeopardize coverage.
          </p>
          <p className="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-6">
            Government vehicle involvement creates special procedural requirements including shortened filing deadlines. Claims against government entities require administrative claims within six months. These strict deadlines demand immediate legal consultation.
          </p>
