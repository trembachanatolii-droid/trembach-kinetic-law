    {
      category: 'deadlines',
      question: "What's the deadline to file a bus accident claim in California?",
      answer: "The deadline depends on who operated the bus: Government buses (MTA, school, city): You must file a government claim within 6 MONTHS of the accident. If denied, you have 6 months from denial to file a lawsuit. Private buses: You generally have 2 years to file a lawsuit. Federal vehicles: 2 years under the Federal Tort Claims Act. Missing the 6-month government deadline usually eliminates your right to compensation entirely."
    },
    {
      category: 'deadlines',
      question: "What happens if I miss the 6-month government claim deadline?",
      answer: "Missing the 6-month deadline for government claims usually bars your case permanently. However, there are very limited exceptions: Late claims may be accepted if you can prove you discovered the claim late due to physical or mental incapacitation, or if you can show the government entity was aware of the accident. These exceptions are rare and difficult to prove. Contact an attorney immediately even if you think you've missed the deadline."
    },

    {
      category: 'liability',
      question: "What if I was standing when the bus crashed?",
      answer: "Standing passengers often suffer the most severe injuries since they have nothing to protect them during sudden stops or collisions. Common carriers must protect standing passengers by avoiding sudden acceleration or braking when possible, warning passengers before unavoidable sudden movements, ensuring handrails and straps work properly, and not exceeding standing passenger capacity. The bus company can't blame you for standing when seats weren't available or when you were preparing to exit."
    },
    {
      category: 'liability',
      question: "Can I sue if the bus driver slammed on brakes and I got hurt?",
      answer: "Yes. While drivers sometimes must brake suddenly for safety, they're liable if the sudden stop was due to following too closely, distracted driving, speeding requiring emergency braking, failing to warn passengers when possible, or poor route planning creating dangerous situations. Even if braking was necessary, the bus company may be liable if passengers weren't given adequate handholds or if the bus was overcrowded."
    },
    {
      category: 'compensation',
      question: "What damages can I recover from a California bus accident?",
      answer: "California bus accident victims can recover: Medical expenses (emergency care, surgery, medication, physical therapy, future treatments), Lost wages (time missed from work, reduced earning capacity, lost benefits), Pain and suffering (physical pain, emotional distress, loss of enjoyment of life), Property damage (damaged belongings, clothing, electronics), Disability/disfigurement compensation for permanent injuries, Wrongful death (funeral costs, lost support, loss of companionship), and Punitive damages for extremely reckless conduct (rare against government)."
    },
    {
      category: 'medical',
      question: "What if I can't afford medical treatment after a bus accident?",
      answer: "Don't let lack of insurance or money prevent you from getting treatment. We connect you with doctors who provide treatment on a lien basis (paid from settlement), emergency rooms must treat you regardless of ability to pay, many providers will wait for payment pending your case, your health insurance should cover treatment (they'll seek reimbursement from settlement), and some government programs provide immediate assistance. Getting prompt treatment is crucial for your health and your case."
    },
    {
      category: 'process',
      question: "Do I need a lawyer for a bus accident claim?",
      answer: "While not legally required, bus accident cases involve complexities making legal representation crucial including strict 6-month deadline for government claims, multiple potentially liable parties, complex common carrier laws, aggressive insurance company tactics, need for accident reconstruction experts, and governmental immunity issues. Studies show represented victims receive 3-5 times more compensation than those without attorneys, even after legal fees."

    {
      category: 'liability',
      question: "What's California's common carrier law for buses?",
      answer: "California Civil Code 2100 requires common carriers (including all buses) to use 'utmost care and diligence' for passenger safety. This means a higher standard than regular 'reasonable care,' must do everything reasonably possible to prevent harm, liable for even slight negligence, must provide safe vehicles and competent drivers, and must protect passengers from other passengers' misconduct. This strict standard makes it easier to prove bus company liability compared to regular auto accidents."
    },
    {
      category: 'process',
      question: "Can I sue a school district for a school bus accident?",
      answer: "Yes, but special rules apply: Must file government claim within 6 months, districts have some governmental immunities, cannot get punitive damages, damage caps may apply in some situations, and must prove district negligence (not just driver error). School districts are liable for inadequate driver training, poor supervision, dangerous routes, or failing to protect students. California law provides special protections for injured children."
    },

    {
      category: 'compensation',
      question: "How much is my bus accident case worth?",
      answer: "Case values vary greatly based on severity of injuries (TBI and spinal injuries often exceed $1 million), age and income of victim, fault determination, available insurance coverage, and government vs. private liability. Our former defense experience helps us accurately evaluate cases and pursue maximum compensation from all available sources."
